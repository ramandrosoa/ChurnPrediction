# Churn Prediction

Companies aim to decrease churn and retain users, thus they employ machine learning to predict which users are at the highest risk of churn, allowing them to deploy targeted interventions effectively. We will be addressing the churn prediction problem for a unique group of subscribers on a video streaming service. The task is to build a model that predicts which subscribers are likely to churn, enabling the company to take proactive measures to retain its customers.

## Notebook Content
In the accompanying [notebook](ChurnPrediction (1).ipynb)
, you will find detailed steps of the data analysis process, including:

  - Univariate and Bivariate Analysis: Exploring individual variables and their relationships to understand the data better
  -  Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling
  - Algorithm Comparison: Evaluating different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest to determine the best model for churn prediction.
